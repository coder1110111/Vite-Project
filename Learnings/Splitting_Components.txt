Splitted Calendar FUnctionality into a Seperate Components
And for practice Splitted the Map Function in main App.jsx

Great question! Splitting a component into smaller ones is a core principle of React and helps with code reusability, readability, and maintainability. You should consider splitting a component when any of the following applies:

✅ 1. Too Large or Complex
If a component is getting too big (e.g., hundreds of lines or deeply nested logic), split it. Each component should ideally focus on a single responsibility.

🔸 Example:
An Expenses component handling both:

Layout

State logic

List rendering

Filters
Consider splitting into:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<ExpensesFilter />
<ExpensesList />
<ExpensesChart />
✅ 2. Has Distinct Sub-Parts
If your JSX includes sections that look like separate visual blocks, you can break them into components.

🔸 Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<Card>
  <CardHeader />
  <CardBody />
  <CardFooter />
</Card>
✅ 3. Reusability
If you find yourself copy-pasting similar JSX, or if a UI block might be reused elsewhere, make it a component.

🔸 Example:
<ExpenseItem /> can be reused wherever an expense needs to be displayed.

✅ 4. Separation of Concerns
You can split components by:

Presentational Components (UI-only, stateless)

Container Components (handle logic, state, API)

🔸 Example:
<ExpenseItem /> – Presentational
<ExpensesContainer /> – Handles filtering, sorting, state

✅ 5. Improved Readability & Testing
Small components are easier to:

Read

Understand

Test independently

✅ 6. Conditional Rendering
If part of your JSX renders conditionally, especially based on props or state, you might separate that logic into a smaller component.

✅ 7. Custom Hooks or State Management
If a component has too much state or effects, consider breaking part of the logic into:

A custom hook (useFilteredExpenses)

A state-handling container

🔻When Not to Split Too Early
Don’t split just for the sake of it.

Don’t over-engineer tiny blocks unless needed later.

Avoid prop-drilling deeply for components that aren’t reused.

🚀 Rule of Thumb
“One component, one responsibility.”

If you're describing your component like:

“This component displays expenses and filters and handles sorting and manages local storage and shows error messages…”

🛑 That's a red flag. Split it up.
